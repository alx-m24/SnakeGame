    A basic remake of the classic SnakeGame made using C++ and <a href="https://www.sfml-dev.org">SFML.</a>
  </b>
</p>

## About
<b>Fun Fact: </b>This small project is actually the first one that I completed at 100%.

The project was started on the 5th January 2024 and only took 9 days to complete. This version of the popular game, Snake Game, is really minimalistic and does not even use textures for the sake of simplicity. Moreover it can only run on windows as I used the MSVC compiler along with <a href="https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/">Visual Studio</a>. While making it, I did not really care about small details and how polished the final build would be as it was just a way to keep me entertained during the Christmas vacations. Also, I just wanted to test my capabilities as a new programmer and, to be honest, I am really proud of the final product.

However, I know that there are surely tons of improvements that can be made to not only make the game more appealing but also to increase the overall performance and readability of the code.

## Performance
This build is capable of handling around <b>5000</b> apples and body parts(of the snake) at around <b>60 FPS</b>

<b>Note:</b> I am aware that it is not a lot but it is not possible for the player to reach this amount of body parts without cheating.

## How to play

If for any reason you want to play the game this crapy remake of a game that has already been coded thousands of time, here is a simple guide of how to build it: 
<ol>
  <li>Copy only the <a href="https://github.com/alx-m24/SnakeGame/tree/master/Release">Relase Folder</a> to any of your local folders.</li>
  <li>Run the SnakeGame.exe file. (Don't worry, there are no threats to running it. If you still have doubts, you could you use the other method and build the project by yourseft.)</li>
</ol>

<b>Or</b>(Build the project by yourself):
<ol>
  <li>Clone the repo to any of your local folders.</li>
  <li>Open the <a href="https://github.com/alx-m24/SnakeGame/blob/master/SnakeGame.sln">SnakeGame.sln</a> file in Visual Studio.</li>
  <li>Build it using the C/C++ MSVC compiler in Visual Studio.</li>
</ol>
